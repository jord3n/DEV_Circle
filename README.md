# DEV_Circle
This website seamlessly integrates a JSON-based mock server, leveraging the Fetch API for streamlined data retrieval, posting, and deletion, while generating a paginated display of individual posts. Users have complete control, with the ability to create, edit, and delete their own posts, while also exploring an array of content from others within the JSON dataset. A click on any individual post grants users access to its full content, enhancing their interactive experience.
